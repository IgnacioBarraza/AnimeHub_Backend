# Anime Hub Backend

This is the backend API for the Anime Hub project, an anime data platform that provides users with detailed anime information, user reviews, and community features. Built with Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and MongoDB, this API supports CRUD operations on anime data and user management, and provides endpoints for handling various anime-related queries and features.

## Project Information

The Anime Hub backend API enables interactions with anime data, such as fetching details, managing user accounts, and storing reviews. It serves as the core data provider for the Anime Hub frontend, connecting users to a comprehensive anime database. This backend is optimized for high performance, featuring robust CRUD support and integration with MongoDB.
